DESCRIPTION

This creates the named branch based on the integration branch.

EXAMPLE

Assuming that the the integration branch on the server is "master", \
typing "git new-fb my_feature" will do roughly the following \
for you:
  $ git checkout my_feature origin/master

Also, if you are currently on the "_parking_" branch (see "git to-master"), \
this will remove that branch.
