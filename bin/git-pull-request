DESCRIPTION

This creates a Pull Request on the GitHub server associated with the current \
branch. For the reasons why Pull Requests are useful for the development process, \
see https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests

The "git pull-request" command is a nice, simplified alternative to using the \
web interface.

EXAMPLE

You've been developing your killer new feature or bug fix, and you want \
someone else to look at it (to do code-review or otherwise provide input). \
When you do "git pull-request", it synchronizes the current branch with \
the server (effectively executing "git sync") and creates the Pull Request \
against the integration branch. (Usually "master", but this can be changed; \
see below.)

The counterpart to this command is "git to-master".

NOTES

* It's assumed that you *never* do any work directly on "master":
  everything is done on a feature branch.  In addition to being a much
  safer and more flexible way of working in general, it is also a
  requirement to take advantage of Pull Request functionality.
* The first time you use a GitHub feature like this, you will be asked
  for your username and password. This does not store them, but instead
  uses them to get an OAuth2 token, which is stored in
  "git config gitProcess.github.authToken".
* If you want to use a different integration branch other than "master",
  set the "gitProcess.integrationBranch" configuration value. (e.g.,
  "git config gitProcess.integrationBranch my-integ-branch")
